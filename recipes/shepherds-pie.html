        <h3 class="subheader">Mashed Potatoes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lbs. Yukon Gold Potatoes</li>
            <li>1/5 cup Dairy-Free Margarine</li>
            <li>1/5 cup Toffuti Soy Sour Cream (or your favorite brand of milk!)</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3 class="subheader">Lamb Filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince carrots, mushrooms and onion finely. Bring them to a medium-high pan with the olive oil and saute until browned, stirring constantly for 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li>After the vegetables have given up most of their moisture, add the ground lamb into the same pan. Allow the lamb to sear on one side before breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Let the lamb cook until it's browned evenly and the fat has rendered out and the water is cooked off.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You'll know when all the moisture has evaporated when instead of hissing or sizzling it sounds like crackling! You should be able to smell the meat browning too.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and the minced garlic. Saute until fragrant, 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Deglaze with the beef broth and red wine. Make sure to scrape up the fond from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Add worcestershire sauce, rosemary, and thyme and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Add frozen peas and stir together.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a casserole dish and top with mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li>Place into a 375F preheated oven for 20 minutes. Let sit for another 20 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="subheader">Mashed Potatoes:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse, peel, and quarter potatoes. Add them to a pot and cover with water. Season generously with salt. Bring the pot to a boil and cook potatoes until they're soft enough to be pierced with a fork.</li>
                <li>Strain the potatoes and bring them back to the pot. Add margarine and cream and mash.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Honestly you can use whatever animal or plant based milk product for this step and however much you want to achieve the texture you want. As long as it has fat it'll be fine so like don't use rice milk or something.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper</li>    
            </ol>
