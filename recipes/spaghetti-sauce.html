        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1.5 lbs. Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1.5 lbs. Italian Sausage</li>
            <li>3 28 oz. cans Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 6 oz. can Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1 Large Onion</li>
            <li>1 lbs. Carrots</li>
            <li>1 bottle White Wine</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Chicken Bouillon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Fish Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely chop the carrots and onion. In a large pot (at least 7 quarts), fry the vegetables in olive oil on high heat until soft, stirring constantly. Dump them out into a bowl or plate.</li>
            <li>In the big pot, fry the ground meat in olive oil on high heat, stirring and scraping constantly with a wooden spoon to keep meatballs from forming. Cook until most of the water evaporates and the pan starts to crackle. Put in the tomato paste and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>When the brown stuff on the bottom of the pot looks like it's about to burn, pour in the wine and and tomatoes and scrape to release everything on the bottom. Stir in a big spoonful of the bouillon. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for two hours, stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom doesn't stick and burn.</li>
            <li>After two hours, season the sauce with the herbs, garlic powder, and fish sauce. Simmer an additional hour. When it's the desired thickness, taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Use, or freeze in ice cube trays.</li>
        </ol>
