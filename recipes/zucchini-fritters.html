        <h1>Zucchini Fritters</h1>
        <h3><a href="../index.html">Home</a></h3>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I stole this from a cookbook hehe. I did make some alterations though.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium zucchini (1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds)</li>
            <li>1 medium Yukon Gold potato (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> corn starch</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup lightly packed basil leaves (about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> ounce)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>flaky salt and lemon wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the zucchini in half crosswise, then into thin planks lengthwise. 
                Stack three or four planks and cut them into long strips to make thin matchsticks. Scrub and 
                peel the potato, then cut into thin matchsticks as you did the zucchini.</li>

            <li>Transfer zucchini and potato to a colander or large sieve and season with two teaspoons kosher salt. 
                Toss to coat, squeezing lightly to soften the vegetables and encourage them to start releasing liquid.
                Let sit for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, corn starch, and baking powder in a small bowl. Roughly chop the basil and beat with the eggs
                in a medium bowl. Finely grate garlic into the eggs, then add the cumin, nutritional yeast, and corn starch 
                mixture. Whisk to combine. Season with kosher salt and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Use a kitchen towel to squeeze excess moisture from the zucchini-potato moisture (a LOT of water should come out).
                Transfer the vegetables to the batter and toss to coat. (also if you're into cheese now would be the time to add it.)
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325&deg;F. Fit a rimmed baking sheet with a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Heat <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup oil in a large cast iron skillet or shallow dutch oven over 
            medium to medium-high heat until a pinch of batter bubbles energetically within a few seconds of being added 
            Working in three batches, scoop <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-cupfuls of the batter into the hot oil and press 
            down to flatten fritter to about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of an inch. Cook until golden brown and crisp 
            on the underside, 3 to 4 minutes, then turn, press down again, and cook until the second side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
            Transfer to prepared rack to drain, repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Move fritters on rack (atop the baking sheet) to the oven and bake until a few shades darker and crisp around the edges, 
                30 to 35 minutes. Serve with flaky salt and lemon wedges.
            </li>
        </ol>
